To make use of this .vimrc you need to set up pathogen for vim, then after setting up pathogen you will put into the bundle folder
the appropriate files from these repos: airblade / vim-gitgutter, vim-syntastic / syntastic, morhetz / gruvbox, and ycm-core / YouCompleteMe
YouCompleteMe is special and you need to follow the setup instructions on the repo for it
then simply use the .vimrc provided and your good to go
